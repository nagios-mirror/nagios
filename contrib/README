Nagios Contrib README
#####################

This directory contains various programs, scripts, etc. that
have been contribed by various people.  Read the source code
if you want to find who did what.

Here is a description of what you'll find...


Conversion Programs:
--------------------

- convertcfg.c is a program to quickly convert old "host" config
  files to the new template-based object config files.  It can also
  convert extended host information definitions. Type 'make convertcfg'
  to compile the utility.


Database Creation Scripts:
--------------------------

- You'll find scripts to create tables for MySQL and PostgreSQL for
  in the database/ subdirectory.  Use these scripts if you want to
  store status, comment, downtime, and other data in a database
  instead of a flat text file.  No, the tables are not normalized.
  They're not *meant* to be.


Additional CGIs:
----------------

- ministatus.c is a very stripped down version of the status CGI.  It
  does not use the authorization function of the CGIs.  If you want to
  compile this CGI, move it to the CGI source code folder (../cgi) and
  type 'make ministatus.cgi' from within that folder.

- traceroute.cgi is (surprise) a CGI that allows you to do a traceroute
  to a specific IP address.  Simply do a 'chmod +x' to make it executeable
  and place it in the CGI directory (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/sbin).
  Requires Perl.

- daemonchk.c is a CGI contributed by Karl DeBisschop that can test to
  see whether or not the Nagios process is running.


Miscellaneous Goodies:
----------------------

- htaccess.sample is a *sample* .htaccess file that can be used with
  Apache to require password authentication for access to the web
  interface.

- mini_epn.c is a mini embedded Perl interpreter that can be used to
  test the feasibility of running various Perl plugins with the
  embedded Perl interpreter compiled in.
