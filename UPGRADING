UPGRADING TO NAGIOS 2.6
=======================

For Nagios 2.x Users:
---------------------
If you're upgrading from an earlier version of Nagios 2.x, upgrading is
pretty simple.  Nothing has changed with the configuration files, so you
can simply recompile and install the new binaries and web interface and 
you'll be good to go.


For Nagios 1.x Users:
---------------------
If you're upgrading from Nagios 1.0, there will be a few modifications
that you'll need to make to your config files.  Read the "What's New"
section of the HTML documentation for more information.
