Upgrading from Nagios 1.x to 1.2
--------------------------------

No config file changes should be necessary.  Nagios 1.1 and
1.2 were bug fix releases only.



Upgrading to Nagios 1.x from NetSaint 0.0.7
-------------------------------------------

Yes, upgrading is going to be a bit of a pain, but it was ten
times more difficult for me to change the code, documentation, 
etc, soo deal with it...


- The default program path, URL alias, etc. are now as follows

	PHYSICAL PATH:		/usr/local/nagios/
	CGI ALIAS:		/nagios/cgi-bin/
	URL ALIAS:		/nagios/

- The default user/group that Nagios runs under is nagios/nagios.

- The main config file (by default) is now nagios.cfg instead of
  netsaint.cfg

- The CGI config file is now called cgi.cfg instead of nscgi.cfg

- Archived log files must be renamed from "netsaint-<date>.log"
  format to "nagios-<date>.log" format. You can rename all your
  archived log files with the following command (assuming you've
  already moved them to their new directory location):

 	rename netsaint nagios netsaint*.log

- The format of the retention file (or database, if that's what
  you were using) has changed to support more variables.  No
  conversion utility is yet available.

- If you were using DB support for status, retention, comment, or
  extended info, make sure to recreate the databases using the
  sample scripts provided in the contrib/database directory.  You
  could also just alter your existing tables - that excercise is 
  left to you to do.
