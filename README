Nagios 1.x README
-----------------


Nagios is a host/service/network monitoring program written in C and
released under the GNU General Public License.  CGI programs are
included to allow you to view the current status, history, etc via
a web interface if you so desire.

Features:

1) Monitoring of network services (via SMTP, POP3, HTTP, PING, etc).
2) A plugin interface to allow for user-developed service monitoring methods.
3) Notifications when problems occur and get resolved (via email, pager,
   or user-defined method).
4) Ability to define "event handlers" for proactive problem resolution
5) Web output (current status, notifications, problem history, log file, etc.)
6) Automatic log file rotation/archiving

For quick and dirty installation instructions, read the INSTALL file.  For
more complete instructions and program documentation, use a web browser to
read the HTML files in the html/docs directory.  If this is your first time
using Nagios I would highly recommend reading the HTML documentation.

For instructions on upgrading to the current version of Nagios, read the
UPGRADING file carefully.

Visit the Nagios homepage at http://www.nagios.org for online
documentation, new releases, bug reports, information on the mailing
lists, etc.
