Nagios 3.x Change Log
#####################

NOTE:
This change log isn't very detailed (or organized) as of yet.  Nagios
3.0 development is just getting started, so documentation, etc. will
lag development for a while.

Pre-alpha changes since 02/15/2006...
-------------------------------------

* Adaptive monitoring:
     - Check timeperiod can now be modified on-the-fly

* Notification changes:
     - Added first_notification_delay to host and object definitions to delay first notification

* Object changes: 
     - Added ability to use multiple template names (separated by commas) in object definitions
     - Added ability to null out optional character directives in object definitions (using 'null' without quotes)
     - Added hostgroup_members and servicegroup_members directives to hostgroup and servicegroup definitions,
       respectively, for allowing including host or service members from "sub" groups.
     - Added support for custom variables in host, service, and contact definitions
     - Added host_notifications_enabled, service_notifications_enabled, can_submit_commands to contact definitions
     - Added optional display_name directive to host and service definitions
     - Removed serviceextinfo definitions and merged variables with service definitions
     - Removed hostextinfo definitions and merged variables with host definitions

* Performance optimizations:
     - Added ability to precache object config files
     - Added ability to exclude object relationship and circular path
       checks from verification process

* Check output:
     - Multiline output support for host and service checks

* Macro changes:
     - Added $LONGHOSTOUTPUT$ and $LONGSERVICEOUTPUT$ macros
     - Added $TEMPPATH$ macro
     - Removed $COMMENTDATAFILE$ and $DOWNTIMEDATAFILE$ macros
     - Added $HOSTDISPLAYNAME$ and $SERVICEDISPLAYNAME$ macros
     - Custom host/service/contact macros accessible via $_HOST<varname>$, $_SERVICE<varname>, or $_CONTACT<varname>$.
       On-demand host/service macros for custom vars are working.  Custom vars are also set as environment vars.

* Flapping changes:
     - Added flap_detection_options directive to host and service definitions to control which
       states (i.e. OK, WARNING, UNKNOWN, and/or CRITICAL) are used in flap detection logic

* External command changes:
     - Added PROCESS_FILE external command to allow processing of external commands found in
       an external (regular) file.  Very useful for passive checks with long output or scripting.

* Status data changes:
     - Contact status information is now saved (although it is not processed by the old CGIs)

* Retention data changes:
     - Contact status information is now retained across program restarts
     - Comment and downtime IDs are now stored across program restarts, should be unique unless reset

* Downtime changes:
     - Scheduled downtime entries are now stored in the status and retention files

* Comment changes:
     - Comments are now stored in the status and retention files

* Host check logic changes:
     - Most host checks are now run asynchronously, in parallel!
     - Scheduled host checks now help improve performance, instead of hinder it (if caching is enabled)
     - Added cached_host_check_horizon option for enabling use of cached host check results
     - Added enable_predictive_host_dependency_checks for enabling predictive checks of dependent hosts
     - Added retry_interval to host definitions
     - Added check_for_orphaned_hosts option and support for orphaned host checks

* Service check logic changes:
     - 'parallelize' option in service definitions deprecated/no longer used
     - Added cached_service_check_horizon option for enabling use of cached service check results
     - Added enable_predictive_service_dependency_checks for enabling predictive checks of dependent services

* Dependency changes:
     - Host and service dependencies can now have a timeperiod during which they're valid (dependency_period directive)

* Misc changes:
     - More information given when testing scheduling (-s command line option)
     - Removed fixed length restrictions for host names and service descriptions
     - Plugin output length restriction bumped up to 2K
     - Added temp_path directive to main config file for specifying temp directory
     - Multiline output support for system commands via my_system()
     - Added global event_id and notification_id vars that are at least unique during a single run of Nagios
     - Default is now to check for orphaned services, rather than not
     - Renamed service_reaper_frequency to check_result_reaper_frequency
     - Fractional notification and check intervals are now supported (e.g. "3.5" minutes)
