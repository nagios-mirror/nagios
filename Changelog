Nagios 3.x Change Log
#####################

NOTE:
This change log isn't very detailed (or organized) as of yet.  Nagios
3.0 development is just getting started, so documentation, etc. will
lag development for a while.

Pre-alpha changes since 02/15/2006...
-------------------------------------
* Adaptive monitoring:
     - Check timeperiod can now be modified on-the-fly
* Notification changes:
     - Added first_notification_delay to host and object definitions to delay first notification
* Object changes: 
     - Added ability to use multiple template names (separated by commas) in object definitions
     - Added ability to null out optional character directives in object definitions (using 'null' without quotes)
* Performance optimizations:
     - Added ability to precache object config files
     - Added ability to exclude object relationship and circular path
       checks from verification process
* Check output:
     - Multiline output support for service checks (not Perl checks with embedded Perl support yet)

     - Added $LONGHOSTOUTPUT$ and $LONGSERVICEOUTPUT$ macros
* Flapping changes:
     - Added flap_detection_options directive to host and service definitions to control which

* External command changes:
     - Added PROCESS_FILE external command to allow processing of external commands found in
       an external (regular) file.  Very useful for passive checks with long output or scripting.
