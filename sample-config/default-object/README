====================
SAMPLE CONFIG README
====================

This directory contains sample object definition config files for
use with the DEFAULT (OLD-STYLE) object routines in Nagios.  You
need to use the --with-default-objects option when running the
configure script in order to use this config file format.

Sample config files have a .cfg extension.  Ignore any files with
a .in extension, as they are templates used to generate the sample
config files.

Please note that you can keep all of your object definitions in a
single file if you wish.  You may also split them up into multiple
config files, as is done here (for clarity).  Read the HTML docs
for information on how to include multiple object config files.


Note:

Sample command definitions have been split into two sepearate files:

  misccommands.cfg 	- This file contains sample notification
			  commands, performance data commands, etc.

  checkcommands.cfg	- This file contains sample command
			  definitions for host and service checks.
			  These definitions are highly volatile, as
			  plugin arguments can change between releases!
