Template-based Extended Info Config File README
-----------------------------------------------

The files in this directory are sample config files that can
be used if you have compiled the CGIs with support for 
template-based extended information definitions.  This is done
by supplying the --with-template-extinfo option to the configure
script.

Different types of definitions are spread across multiple files
for convenience and clarity.  You could choose to keep all types
of definitions in a single file if you wanted.  

In order to use the template-based config files with the CGIs,
you'll have to add one or more lines to your CGI config file
(i.e. /usr/local/nagios/etc/cgi.cfg) that look like this:

xedtemplate_config_file=<hostextinfofile>
xedtemplate_config_file=<serviceextinfofile>
...
etc.
