SAMPLE CONFIG README
====================

This directory contains sample object definition config files for
use with the TEMPLATE-BASED object routines in Nagios.  This is
the default type of object definition file for Nagios and the CGIs.

Sample config files have a .cfg extension.  Ignore any files with
a .in extension, as they are templates used to generate the sample
config files.

Please note that you can keep all of your object definitions in a
single file if you wish.  You may also split them up into multiple
config files, as is done here (for clarity).  Read the HTML docs
for information on how to include multiple object config files.


NOTE:

A minimalistic config file called minimal.cfg provides a barebones
example of a config file that might be easy for new users to
understand.  It contains all types of definitions you need to get
started (hosts, hostgroups, services, command, contacts, etc...)


Note:

Sample command definitions have been split into two sepearate files:

  misccommands.cfg 	- This file contains sample notification
			  commands, performance data commands, etc.

  checkcommands.cfg	- This file contains sample command
			  definitions for host and service checks.
			  These definitions are highly volatile, as
			  plugin arguments can change between releases!
