Template-based Object Config File README
----------------------------------------

The files in this directory are sample config files that can
be used if you have compiled Nagios and the CGIs with 
support for template-based object definitions.  This is done
by supplying the --with-template-objects option to the configure
script.

Different types of definitions are spread across multiple files
for convenience and clarity.  You could choose to keep all types
of definitions in a single file if you wanted.  

In order to use the template-based config files with Nagios,
you'll have to add one or more lines to your MAIN config file
(i.e. /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg) that look like this:

xodtemplate_config_file=<commandfile>
xodtemplate_config_file=<contactfile>
xodtemplate_config_file=<hostfile>
...
etc.
