SAMPLE OBJECT CONFIG FILE README
================================

This directory contains sample object definition config files for
use with the TEMPLATE-BASED object configuration file format.  This is
now the only type of file format supported by Nagios "out of the box".

Sample config files have a .cfg extension.  Ignore any files with
a .in extension, as they are templates used to generate the sample
config files.

Please note that you can keep all of your object definitions in a
single file if you wish.  You may also split them up into multiple
config files, as is done here.  Read the HTML docs for information
on how to include multiple object config files.



FILE DESCRIPTIONS:
------------------

  minimal.cfg		- This is a minimalistic object config file that
			  should be easier for new users to understand.
			  It contains all types of object definitions you
			  need to get started (hosts, services, etc..)

  bigger.cfg            - A larger object config file than the minimalistic
			  one provided above.  This file shows more detail
			  one how you can configure objects, etc.  The two
			  command configuration files (described below) are
			  necessary to complete the definitions found in this
			  file.

  misccommands.cfg 	- This file contains sample notification commands, 
			  performance data commands, etc.

  checkcommands.cfg	- This file contains sample command definitions for
			  host and service checks.  These definitions are 
			  highly volatile, as plugin arguments can change 
			  between plugin releases!
