# We define a generic printer template that can be used for most printers we monitor

define host{
	name			generic-printer	; The name of this host template
	use			generic-host	; Inherit default values from the generic-host template
	check_period		24x7		; By default, printers are monitored round the clock
	check_interval		5		; Actively check the printer every 5 minutes
	retry_interval		1		; Schedule host check retries at 1 minute intervals
	max_check_attempts	10		; Check each printer 10 times (max)
	check_command		check-host-alive	; Default command to check if printers are "alive"
	notification_period	workhours		; Printers are only used during the workday
	notification_interval	30		; Resend notifications every 30 minutes
	notification_options	d,r		; Only send notifications for specific host states
	contact_groups		admins		; Notifications get sent to the admins by default
	register		0		; DONT REGISTER THIS - ITS JUST A TEMPLATE
	}



# Define a host for the printer we'll be monitoring
# Change the host_name, alias, and address to fit your situation

define host{
	use		generic-printer		; Inherit default values from a template
	host_name	hplj2605dn		; The name we're giving to this printer
	alias		HP LaserJet 2605dn	; A longer name associated with the printer
	address		192.168.1.30		; IP address of the printer

# Change the host_name to match the name of the host you defined above
# If the printer has an SNMP community string other than "public", change the check_command directive to reflect that

define service{
	use			generic-service		; Inherit values from a template
	host_name		hplj2605dn		; The name of the host the service is associated with
	service_description	Printer Status		; The service description
